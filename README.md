# warehouse_management-automation

This is the project on which I took a part in project structure creation procedure and created scripts for test automation and kept the project files up to date.
The following tests were fully created by me:
   - warehouseManagementSystemUi/src/test/java/ui/ArchiveTests.java
   - warehouseManagementSystemUi/src/test/java/ui/UniqueArticlesSearchTests.java
   - warehouseManagementSystemUi/src/test/java/ui/CreateNewWarehouseManagementSystemTest.java

The following tests were partially modified by me:
   - warehouseManagementSystemUi/src/test/java/ui/ArchiveTests.java
   - warehouseManagementSystemUi/src/test/java/ui/DeleteLinkedUniqArticleTests.java


## Common tech stack to be installed

For building this project it is necessary to install the following:

- Installed Java 8 ([Java Downloads](http://jdk.java.net/java-se-ri/8-MR3))
- Installed Git ([Git Downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads))
- Installed Maven 3.3+ ([Maven Downloads](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi))

## Set up and running tests

```
   $ https://gitlab2.warehouse_management.se/qa-tools/warehouse_management-automation
   $ mvn clean verify
```
Also test run can be customized to use specific test or feature, for example

```
   $ mvn test -Dgroups=Smoke -pl warehouseManagementSystem
```

In both cases we have automatically generated Allure report, for more details use this link
([Allure Report](https://docs.qameta.io/allure/))
Otherwise, report can be generated by separate CLI command

```
   $ mvn allure:report
```
After executing report will be available in build directory and can be opened through index.html file in any of browsers:
```
   $ /target/site/allure-maven-plugin
```
